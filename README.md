## Project Sought

I have a broad set of skills that I can apply to a lot of different projects. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to a project where I can apply both my technical expertise and collaborative skills, while also learning from new challenges and technologies. I am currently taking a course about deep learning and I would be interested in applying those skills for my senior design project. 

I do not currently have a team or an idea, but I am interested in the topics of climate change and transportation.

# Project Abstract (≤400 characters)

This project develops a machine‑learning application that identifies bird species from photos and audio recordings. By combining computer vision and sound classification, the system assists birdwatchers, researchers, and conservationists with accurate, real‑time identification.

---

# Project Description (Assignment #2)

We aim to create a mobile and web‑based application that ingests user‑submitted bird images and sound clips, processes them through deep‑learning classifiers, and outputs likely species matches. The project involves dataset collection, preprocessing, model training for both modalities, system deployment, and user‑centered interface design.

# User Stories and Design Diagrams (Assignment #4)

## User Stories

* **As a birdwatcher**, I want to upload a photo to identify a bird quickly.
* **As a researcher**, I want accurate species predictions from audio so I can survey populations.
* **As a beginner**, I want explanations and confidence scores so I can learn bird traits.

## Design Diagrams

### Level 0 (Context Diagram)

* **Users** provide photos/audio → **Bird ID Application** → returns **species predictions, confidence, info**.
* External datasets provide training data.

### Level 1 (Data Flow Diagram)

1. **User Input** (photo/audio)
2. **Preprocessing** (image resizing, spectrogram generation)
3. **Model Inference** (CNN for images, audio classifier for sound)
4. **Prediction Fusion** (optional combined ranking)
5. **Results Display**

### Level 2 (Detailed Component Diagram)

* **Frontend:** Upload interface, feedback panel
* **Backend API:** Input routing, validation
* **Image Pipeline:** CNN model, feature extraction
* **Audio Pipeline:** Spectrogram generator, audio classifier
* **Fusion Module:** Aggregates predictions
* **Database:** Species metadata, stored sightings

## Description of Diagrams

* **Context Diagram:** Shows system boundaries and external interactions.
* **Data Flow Diagram:** Describes sequential processing of user input.
* **Component Diagram:** Breaks down subsystems, their roles, and communication pathways.
